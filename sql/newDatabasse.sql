Youll learn how to structure your code for reuse and to be easier to understand, manage, and expand using&nbsp;<strong>modules and understand how modules really work</strong>.</p>\n<p>Youll learn&nbsp;<strong>how asynchronous code works in Node and the Node event loop</strong>, as well as how to use the&nbsp;<strong>event emitter, streams, buffers, pipes, and work with files</strong>. Well see how that leads to&nbsp;<strong>building a web server in Node</strong>.</p>\n<p>Well dive into<strong>&nbsp;web sites, web apps and APIs with Express</strong>&nbsp;and learn how Express can save us time as Node developers.</p>\n<p>Youll also gain an understanding of&nbsp;<strong>npm, connecting to databases, and the MEAN stack</strong>!</p>\n<p>During it all youll gain a deep understanding of the Javascript concepts and other computer science concepts that power Node.</p>\n<p>NodeJS doesnt have to be hard to learn. The biggest mistake most coding tutorials make is expecting someone to learn simply by imitating others code. Real world situations are never exactly like the tutorial.</p>\n<p>I believe the best way to learn is to understand how a tool works and what it does for you, look at examples, and then try it yourself. Thats how this course is built, with the goal to help you both learn and understand NodeJS.</p>\n<p><em>Note: In this course youll also get&nbsp;</em><strong><em>downloadable source code</em></strong><em>. You will often be provided with starter code, giving you the base for you to start writing your code, and finished code to compare your code to.</em></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"styles--audience--2pZ0S\" data-purpose=\"target-audience\">\n<h2 class=\"udlite-heading-xl styles--audience__title--1Sob_\">Who this course is for:</h2>\n<ul class=\"styles--audience__list--3NCqY\">\n<li>Those looking to build a career as a NodeJS developer</li>\n<li>Those desiring to become MEAN stack developers</li>\n<li>Those who dont have server technology experience but wish to gain this skill</li>\n<li>Those coming from other server technologies (like PHP, ASP.NET, or Ruby on Rails) and want to learn Node</li>\n<li>Those who want to only have to write both client and server code in one language: Javascript</li>\n<li>Those who want to grasp Express</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>','<!-- #######  YAY, I AM THE SOURCE EDITOR!
